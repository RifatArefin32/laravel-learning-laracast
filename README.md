# Day-1: Project setup
### Project Dependency
- Install PHP
- Install Composer

composer create-project laravel/laravel your_project_name
```
To start our site, write the following command from terminal
```bash
php artisan serve
```
This command will start the site at `localhost:8000`

Create new github repository for your project and add the project to the repository
- Create a github repository without readme and licence
- Initiate git to the project
- Change the `master` branch into `main`
- Add the remote github repository to the local git
- Add all, commit them and push to the remote repository 

# Day-2: Routes and Views
### Routes
- `./routes/web.php` - for routes that handle web requests.
- `./routes/api.php` - for routes that handle API requests.
- `./routes/console.php` - for defining console commands.
- `./routes/channels.php` - for event broadcasting channels.

Basic Syntax of a route
```bash
Route::get('/example', function () {
    return 'Hello, World!';
});
```

### Views
In Laravel, a `view` is a way to separate our applicationâ€™s logic from its presentation layer. 
- Views are used to represent the output or user interface of your application and typically contain HTML mixed with some **`Laravel Blade templating code`**. 
- Views are stored in the `./resources/views` directory.

# Day-3: Create layout files using laravel components
Laravel components provide a convenient way to create reusable pieces of UI, making it easier to build layouts and encapsulate small pieces of your application's views into self-contained components.

- Create a component directory `./resources/views/components`
- Create a component file `./resources/views/components/layout.blade.php`
- Use this `layout` component at any view file using `<x-layout> some slot value </x-layout>`
- The main content for the layout component is accessed as `$slot` variable
- We can pass some value of the variables in the layout using `<x-slot:variable_name> value </x-slot:variable_name>`
- Components access the attributes of an HTML element as `$attributes` variable

# Day-4: Make a Pretty Layout Using TailwindCSS
Add Play CDN script inside the layout and add a layout design from tailwind.css
```bash
 <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

# Day-5: Props and Blade Directives

| **Feature** | **Description** | **Syntax Example** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Props** | Data passed from parent to child Blade components | `<x-alert type="success" message="Operation successful!" />` |
| **@props** | Declares which data a component expects when using inline Blade components. | `@props(['type' => 'info', 'message'])` |
| **@foreach, @for**| Loop directives for iterating over data in Blade views. | `@foreach($items as $item) <li>{{ $item }}</li> @endforeach` |
| **@if, @else, @elseif** | Conditional directives for adding logic to Blade views. | `@if($user) <p>Hello, {{ $user }}</p> @else <p>Guest</p> @endif` |

### Notes
- **Props** in Laravel Blade are mainly used to pass data to Blade components.
- **Blade Directives** provide a set of predefined syntaxes for common programming structures and templating needs in Blade views.
