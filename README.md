# Day-2: Routes and Views

- `./routes/channels.php` - for event broadcasting channels.

Basic Syntax of a route
```bash
Route::get('/example', function () {
    return 'Hello, World!';
});
```

### Views
In Laravel, a `view` is a way to separate our applicationâ€™s logic from its presentation layer. 
- Views are used to represent the output or user interface of your application and typically contain HTML mixed with some **`Laravel Blade templating code`**. 
- Views are stored in the `./resources/views` directory.

# Day-3: Create layout files using laravel components
Laravel components provide a convenient way to create reusable pieces of UI, making it easier to build layouts and encapsulate small pieces of your application's views into self-contained components.

- Create a component directory `./resources/views/components`
- Create a component file `./resources/views/components/layout.blade.php`
- Use this `layout` component at any view file using `<x-layout> some slot value </x-layout>`
- The main content for the layout component is accessed as `$slot` variable
- We can pass some value of the variables in the layout using `<x-slot:variable_name> value </x-slot:variable_name>`
- Components access the attributes of an HTML element as `$attributes` variable
